Welcome to __Code in Perpetuity__, a (currently one-man project) to store and archive freely-licensed source code of a time long gone. In this organization, you will find time capsules containing source files for as many old projects, software and applications as we can possibly archive, forever archived as to prevent their loss to time. Code in Perpetuity started on 11 June, 2022, with the source code behind a bootleg port of _Super Mario Bros._ to the Apple II. We hope that this is the mere beginning of a great library of free and safeguarded code.

Anyone interested in joining may open an issue in this repository.
